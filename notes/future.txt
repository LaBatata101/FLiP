Future projects for FLiP

Here are some possible future projects to extend FLiP.  These are *not*
list in order of difficulty, importance, or urgency.

- Add a parser, so we can input formulas as strings in the same format
  as they are printed, with operator symbols, infix synax, and
  implicity precedence (optional parentheses).  In the present
  version, formulas must be entered as Formula constructor expressions
  with operator names, prefix syntax, and lots of required
  parentheses.

- Make it easy to store the results of a proof as a derived rule in
  the database of rules, so it can be used for subsequent proofs in
  the same interactive session.  In the present version, the only way
  to add a rule is to add code to a logic module and import it.

- Make it easy to define letters (proposition symbols), variables,
  relations and functions in an interactive session.
