FLiP package organization

FLiP 1.2 organizes the modules (.py source files) into Python packages
(directories that contain an __init__.py file).  Previous versions did
not use packages.  Packages provide several advantages.  They make it
convenient to use FLiP from outside its own development directories,
and add case studies and logics outside those directories.  This makes
it convenient to install FLiP in the usual installation directories
(site-packages or dist-packages or ...), rather then run it right out
of the unpacked distribution.  Packages (along with installation)
remove or very much reduce the need to manipulate PYTHONPATH in order
to use FLiP.  Packages also encourage simpler module names (session.py
and contradiction.py instead of poset_session.py and contra_test.py.
